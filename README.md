## üìä CI/CD & Best Practices

Each project in this repository can be enhanced with CI/CD pipelines using **GitHub Actions**. While the workflows are not yet implemented, here's what can be added:

### Example CI/CD Workflow Structure:
```yaml
name: Deploy to AWS
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
      - name: Configure AWS credentials
      - name: Deploy to AWS
      - name: Run tests
```

### Status Badges
Once GitHub Actions workflows are configured, you can add status badges to monitor build and deployment status:

```markdown
